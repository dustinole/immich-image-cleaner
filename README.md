# 🧹 Immich Image Cleaner

A powerful standalone plugin for Immich that automatically detects and helps remove unwanted images from your photo library. Perfect for cleaning up after data recovery, migration from other services, or general library maintenance.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Smart Detection
- **Screenshots**: Detects all types of screenshots using filename patterns, resolutions, and content analysis
- **Web Cache Images**: Identifies thumbnails, avatars, banners, and other web artifacts
- **Low Quality Images**: Finds tiny thumbnails and corrupted files
- **Data Recovery Artifacts**: Spots temporary files and recovered junk from data recovery tools

### 🔍 Multi-Layer Analysis
- **Leverages Immich's ML**: Uses your existing facial recognition and object detection
- **GPU Acceleration**: Benefits from your configured NVIDIA/hardware acceleration  
- **Smart Processing**: Only downloads images when absolutely necessary
- **Metadata First**: Prioritizes EXIF and filename analysis over heavy image processing
- **Existing Face Data**: Utilizes faces already detected by your Immich instance
- **Efficient Design**: Minimal resource usage by reusing existing ML analysis

### 🎨 Beautiful Web Interface
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates during batch analysis
- **Smart Filtering**: Browse by categories (screenshots, web cache, low quality, etc.)
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and mark multiple items for deletion
- **Confidence Scoring**: Visual confidence indicators for each detection
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on desktop and mobile

### 🛡️ Safe & Controlled
- **No Automatic Deletion**: Flags items for review, you control what gets deleted
- **Confidence Scoring**: Clear indicators of how certain the detection is
- **Detailed Analysis**: See exactly why each item was flagged
- **Backup Integration**: Works alongside your existing backup strategy

## 🧠 Leverages Your Existing Immich ML

### Smart Integration
The Image Cleaner is designed to **use your existing Immich machine learning setup**:

- **Facial Recognition Data**: Uses faces already detected by Immich
- **GPU Acceleration**: Benefits from your NVIDIA/hardware acceleration configuration  
- **Object Detection**: Leverages existing smart search and ML analysis
- **No Duplicate Processing**: Doesn't re-analyze what Immich has already processed
- **Lightweight**: Only downloads thumbnails for additional analysis when needed

### Why This Matters
- **Faster Analysis**: Uses existing data instead of re-processing everything
- **Resource Efficient**: Doesn't compete with Immich for GPU/CPU resources
- **Consistent Results**: Uses the same ML models and thresholds as your main Immich instance
- **Future Proof**: Automatically benefits from Immich ML improvements

## 📈 Performance & Scalability

### Typical Performance
- **Small libraries** (< 10K photos): 15-30 minutes
- **Medium libraries** (10K-50K photos): 1-3 hours  
- **Large libraries** (50K+ photos): 3-8 hours

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: 512MB-1GB RAM
- **CPU**: Minimal (leverages existing Immich ML)
- **Storage**: 100MB for application + analysis database
- **Network**: Minimal (uses Immich API, not direct file access)

### Optimization Tips
- **Run during low usage**: Analysis is I/O intensive
- **Use SSD storage**: Faster image reading and processing
- **Increase memory**: More RAM = better performance
- **Thumbnail mode**: Uses Immich thumbnails for faster analysis

## 🤔 FAQ

### Common Questions

**Q: Will this delete my photos automatically?**
A: No! The plugin only flags items for review. You control all deletions.

**Q: How accurate is the screenshot detection?**
A: Very high accuracy (95%+) for typical screenshots. The confidence scoring helps you make informed decisions.

**Q: Can I run this on a large library?**
A: Yes! Tested on libraries with 200K+ photos. It processes in batches and can be interrupted/resumed.

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: The confidence scoring helps minimize false positives. Items with medium confidence should be manually reviewed.

**Q: Does this work with external libraries?**
A: Yes! It analyzes any photos accessible through the Immich API, including external libraries.

### Performance Issues

**Q: Analysis is running slowly**
A: Try reducing batch size, ensure SSD storage, and run during low-usage periods.
